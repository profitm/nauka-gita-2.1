      <strong>Verse #1:</strong>
      <br>
      <br>One, two, three, four, one, two
      <br>
      <br> Mama, she has taught me well <br>Told me when I was young:
      <br> "Son, your life's an open book <br> Don't close it 'fore it's done"
      <br> "The brightest flame burns quickest" <br> That's what I heard her say
      <br>Son's heart sowed to mother <br>But I must find my way
    </p>

      <br>
      <strong>Chorus:</strong>
      <br>
      <br>Let my heart go
      <br> Let your son grow
      <br> Mama, let my heart go
      <br> Or let this heart be still Yeah, still</p>

    <p class="verse2"><br><strong>Verse #2</strong><br><br>Rebel - my new last name <br>Wild blood in my veins <br> Apron strings around my neck <br>The mark that still remains <br>Left home at
      an early age<br>Of what I heard was wrong<br> I never asked forgiveness<br> but what is said is done</p>
